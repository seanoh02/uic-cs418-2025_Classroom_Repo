# Team Reflection

This document is a collective reflection on your team’s final project experience. Discuss what you learned, what went well, what was challenging, and what you'd do differently next time. This is not just for grading — it's for your own growth as future data scientists and collaborators.

## 1. What Did You Learn?

What are the **most important skills or lessons** you gained through this project?

> Example:
> - Improved our ability to work collaboratively using GitHub
> - Learned how to preprocess messy real-world data
> - Built and interpreted a predictive model with real-world implications

---

## 2. What Went Well?

Describe things that worked effectively in your team — technical or non-technical.

> Example:
> - Clear task delegation and weekly check-ins kept us on track 
> - Our model achieved better performance than expected
> - Our visualizations communicated results clearly to a non-technical audience

---

## 3.  What Was Challenging?

What obstacles did you face — technically or as a team? How did you address them?

> Example:
> - Had difficulty cleaning inconsistent timestamps in the dataset
> - Struggled to balance workload among team members in week 3
> - Initial model had high variance — learned to use cross-validation properly

---

## 4. What Would You Do Differently?

If you could restart this project, what would you change or improve?

> Example:
> - Spend more time selecting the right dataset at the beginning
> - Use version control more rigorously for notebooks

---

## 5. Final Thoughts

Any final takeaways, surprises, or things you’re proud of?

> Example:
> - We didn't expect to enjoy storytelling with data this much!
> - Proud of how well we worked together despite differences
> - We now feel confident tackling independent data science projects
