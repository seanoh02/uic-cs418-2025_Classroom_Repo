# Team Reflection

This document is a collective reflection on your team’s final project experience. Discuss what you learned, what went well, what was challenging, and what you'd do differently next time. This is not just for grading — it's for your own growth as future data scientists and collaborators.

## 1. What Did You Learn?

What are the **most important skills or lessons** you gained through this project?
Improved my ability to work using GitHub and learned real world limitations of data and how to preprocess and clean said data.
Became more familiar with juypter notebook and building models with python.
Data analysis and predicitive design skills were trained and tested to better refine our project to have real world implications. **todo

## 2. What Went Well?

Describe things that worked effectively in your team — technical or non-technical.
Analysis skills were effective at creating parameters that allowed me to improve in other areas of data science.
Presenation skills were challenged and presented with good questions for consideration allowing more interaction with audience. **todo

## 3.  What Was Challenging?

What obstacles did you face — technically or as a team? How did you address them?
My team stopped responding after given another chance at presenting our updated progress. I remedied this situation by doing the project myself. Consistent lack of communication and delegation was the key issues but after being asked what the data set for the last time I decided it was my data set I wanted to work with and not my teams.

## 4. What Would You Do Differently?

If you could restart this project, what would you change or improve?
I would start by myself or had a more reliable team to improve my overall quality of work. My work became rushed and had poor execution because of the assumption I would not be the only one working on the model and analysis. A clear model we were aiming for would have benefited expedition of work.

## 5. Final Thoughts

Any final takeaways, surprises, or things you’re proud of?
**todo
> Example:
> - We didn't expect to enjoy storytelling with data this much!
> - Proud of how well we worked together despite differences
> - We now feel confident tackling independent data science projects
